## Motivation and Preparation

Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", that consists in learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.
  - [MIT Challenge](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)
The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.

## How to use our site

#### Order of the classes

Our curriculum was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are already in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the Introduction to Computer Science section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.

#### Should I take all courses?

Yes! The intention is to conclude all the courses listed here!

#### Duration of the project

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a regular CS course, but I can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to your **motivation/dedication**!

You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest **1 ~ 2 hours every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

See more about <<Commit to a process, not a goal>> [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)

#### Project Based

Here in **OSS University**, you do not need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project**.

##### What does it mean?

After finish a course, you should think about a real world problem that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to validate and consolidate your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

The projects of all students will be listed on their public pages. Submit your project's repository to your personal profile after you conclude it.

You can create this project alone or with other students!

#### Project Suggestions

  - [Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects): A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language.
  - [app-specs](https://github.com/ericdouglas/app-specs): A curated list of applications specifications and implementations to practice new technologies, improve your portfolio and sharpen your skills.
  - [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/): Course that teaches you fullstack JavaScript development through a bunch of projects.
  - [JavaScript Projects](https://github.com/javascript-society/javascript-projects): List of projects related with the [JavaScript Path](https://github.com/javascript-society/javascript-path).

#### Be Creative!

This is a crucial part of your journey through all those courses.

You need to have in mind that what you are able to create with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate and this is what really matters!

In order to show that you really learned those things, you need to be creative!

Here are some tips about how you can do that:

  - **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.

  - **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

#### Cooperative Work

We love cooperative work! Use our [channels](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

#### Content Policy

You must share only files that you are allowed to! Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

[Be creative](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#be-creative) in order to show your progress!
