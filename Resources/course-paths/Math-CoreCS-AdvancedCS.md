### Math

It's most important to learn about **discrete math**, so you can deeply understand algorithms later on. **Single variable calculus** is a prerequisite for this course. **Linear algebra** is used in graphics, machine learning, and cryptography, but not essential to understanding core concepts, feel free to skip it. **Multivariable calculus** and **probability** are required by the typical CS curriculum.

**Single Variable Calculus**

* [ ] [Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1a-differentiation-mitx-18-01-1x) 80 - 120 hours

### Core Computer Science

These are the core topics of CS. Start with an intro class that's appropriate for you. Then continue with one of the algorithms sequences. A strong background in algorithms is essential to being able to write high-quality software, as well as surviving technical interviews. Computer architecture and CS theory are also crucial topics taken by every CS student.
